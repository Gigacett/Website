          <h2> The Climate Change</h2>
          <h3> The result of climate change can be seen 
          thought out the world. One of the most supported 
          theory is that green house gases is trapping the heat that 
          would normally radiate to outer space. As the green house 
          gases build up in our atomsphere they start to form this dense layer of 
          particles and reflecting heat back to the surface. Some of the green house
          gases are CO2, Methane, Nitrous Oxide and CFCs. And based on the 
          data provided by NASA there has been a clear increase in the CO2 parts 
          per million during the last hundred years that human has been on earth.
          This is a clear indiction that there does exist some man made contribution
          to the issue of climate change.Althought the situation might seem dire, 
          it is possible to fix the issue if the general population starts to act now.
          One of the biggest contributor to the climate change is the burning of fossil
          fuel, by going green or nuclear we can avoid putting more green house gas into
          our atomsphere. An other simple solution is to 
          start looking toward space exploration.
