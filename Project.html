          <h1> The Planet Earth</h1>
          <h2> The earth is home to the human 
          species and the only planet that can support human 
          life at the time. However during the recent years there 
          has been an rise in temperature and this is casuing 
          irreversible change to our one and only home. The earth is currently
          4.5 billion years old while humans have only existed for 6 million 
          years. But in the last few hundred of years, the Earth is reaching 
          a new high in its average temperature around the global. This have 
          the potential effect of more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought,
          and more intense storm. While the Glaciers is sinking and risk a flooding 
          of the coastal cities around the world. This can have dire consequences on 
          the human speices as a whole.
